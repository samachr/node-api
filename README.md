# Instant Rest API

Just add your database schema setup to database/db.js and database/config.js like the example and the api will be autogenerated for you.

Also openshift ready. Simply open an account and openshift.com, create a new nodejs application, and use this repository's git clone url as the starting repository.

Boom. Instant Rest API accessible from anywhere.
